# 🏨 Hospitality Domain Dashboard (Power BI Case Study)

Welcome to my data analytics case study, where I built a fully interactive Power BI dashboard to uncover performance insights for **AtliQ Grands**, a luxury hotel chain struggling with market share and revenue. This end-to-end project demonstrates my ability to identify business problems, model data, build metrics, and deliver actionable insights.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India and has been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. Recently, due to aggressive strategies from competitors and internal decision-making issues, the company started losing market share and revenue in both the **luxury** and **business hotel segments**.

To regain control, the Managing Director decided to invest in **Business and Data Intelligence**. However, the company lacked an in-house analytics team. As a result, the revenue management department hired an external data analyst (me) to analyze historical data and generate actionable insights.

## 🎯 Objective

Analyze booking, revenue, occupancy, and customer rating data to answer key business questions:
- What’s the total number of bookings, revenue, and occupancy rate by city?
- Which platforms and room categories contribute most to revenue?
- What are the cancellation trends by month, city, and status?
- How does customer satisfaction (ratings) vary by property and platform?
- Are weekend or weekday stays more popular?
