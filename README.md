# 🏨 Hospitality Domain Dashboard (Power BI Case Study)

A complete Power BI case study analyzing hotel performance for **AtliQ Grands**, a five-star hotel chain in India.  
This project demonstrates my skills in data modeling, DAX, dashboard design, and storytelling with data.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

**AtliQ Grands** has been operating in the luxury and business hotel segment for over 20 years.  
Recently, it began losing market share and revenue due to competitive pressure and poor decision-making.  
To address this, the management decided to invest in **Business and Data Intelligence** — but lacked an internal analytics team.

As an external data analyst, I was tasked with building a dashboard using historical booking and revenue data to identify trends, challenges, and opportunities.
